    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic)). As it was considered “unsinkable”, the Titanic did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",

    "**DataVision** has been commissioned by Her Majesty The Queen to investigate the conditions in which people survived and whether this was because of luck or whether some groups were more likely to survive than others. If discrimination due to gender or socio-economic class is identified, the Queen intends to use this information to change the cruise policies accordinly. \n",

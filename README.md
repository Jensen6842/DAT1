# Data 1: Introduction to Data Science.

## Description
I look into key concepts required to undertake rigorous and valid data analysis. <br />
I look into processes for collecting, manipulating and cleaning data, while gaining experience in judging the quality of data sources. <br />
I look into the key statistical tests for frequentist data science, where specific theories are explored and tested via descriptive and inferential statistics. <br />
I apply my existing programming knowledge to execute these tests in an appropriate programming language using existing statistical libraries.

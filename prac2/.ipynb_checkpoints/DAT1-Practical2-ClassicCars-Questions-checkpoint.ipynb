    "\n",
    "DataVision (the company you are working as a Data Scientist) has been contracted to analyse the data available for the cars and provide insights by analysing the different characteristics of the cars (e.g., speed, price). \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will be presented to the Classic Cars & Co main stakeholders who have limited knowledge about data science. So, your findings should be complemented by a suitable justification explaining what you observe and, when applicable, what does this observation mean and, possibly, why it occurs. The analysis along with the explanation will help them to understand whether they need to invest more to expand their collection."
